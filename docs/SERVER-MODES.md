# Server Modes

`wiki-server` exposes one binary across four runtime surfaces. They share the same vault, services, and MCP tool surface — they differ in which transports and background workers run.

## The four surfaces

| # | Invocation | Use case |
|---|------------|----------|
| 1 | `wiki-server serve` | HTTP + Quartz, no MCP. Browser-only deployment. |
| 2 | `wiki-server serve --mcp-port=N` | HTTP + Quartz **and** MCP-over-HTTP in one process. **Home K8s prod path.** |
| 3 | `wiki-server serve mcp http` | Standalone MCP-over-HTTP (no Quartz, no REST API). |
| 4 | `wiki-server serve mcp stdio` | Per-session MCP-over-stdio. **Work laptop path.** |

`serve mcp` (no transport) is a deprecated alias — cobra prints a deprecation message and shows help.

## Feature matrix

| Feature | (1) `serve` | (2) `serve --mcp-port` | (3) `serve mcp http` | (4) `serve mcp stdio` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HTTP listener (Quartz HTML) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| REST API (`/api/*`) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Raw file serving (`/raw/*`) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| MCP transport | ❌ | streamable-http | streamable-http | stdio |
| MCP tools (read/write/lint/...) | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `whoami` `instance_name` field | n/a | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| OIDC auth (Authentik) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Webhook dispatch | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Filesystem watcher (fsnotify) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Quartz build pipeline | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| TF-IDF search index | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (substring only) | ❌ (substring only) |
| Activity auto-logging on mutations | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Prometheus `/metrics` | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Logs to | stdout (JSON) | stdout (JSON) | stdout (JSON) | **stderr** (JSON) |
| Lifetime | long-lived | long-lived | long-lived | per-session |

Stdio routes logs to stderr because stdout is reserved for the MCP JSON-RPC framing — any log line on stdout corrupts the protocol stream.

## Flags by surface

| Flag | (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--vault` (root) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `--instance-name` (root) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `--port` (HTTP) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `--public-dir` (Quartz output) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `--quartz-dir` (Quartz source) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `--mcp-port` (embed MCP) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `--port` (MCP-only HTTP) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| `--watch` (fsnotify) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

`--instance-name` is honored by every MCP surface. It surfaces as `instance_name` in the `whoami` MCP tool response, letting agents distinguish home-wiki from work-wiki when both are connected.

## When to pick which

**Home K8s deployment (current production):** surface (2). The Helm chart invokes `wiki-server serve --mcp-port=8081` so a single pod serves the website, REST API, and MCP from one process.

**Work laptop:** surface (4). Register in `.mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "work-wiki": {
      "command": "wiki-server",
      "args": ["--vault", "/Users/justin/Obsidian/work-wiki",
               "--instance-name", "work-wiki",
               "serve", "mcp", "stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```
Optional companion: `wiki-server launchd install` schedules a daily `lint` via macOS LaunchAgent.

**MCP-only browser-less server (rare):** surface (3). Useful if you want MCP access from outside the cluster without exposing the Quartz site, or for testing the MCP layer in isolation. Note: no TF-IDF index here either — substring search only.

**Browser-only (no MCP):** surface (1). The default `serve` invocation without `--mcp-port`. Useful if you're hosting the wiki for read-only human consumption and don't want any agent surface.

## Forward-looking note

The HTTP MCP construction is duplicated between surfaces (2) and (3) — they build the same MCP server with overlapping but not identical wiring. Issue #65 tracks unifying them behind a single `runMCP(cfg)` helper. Stdio's "strip everything" stance also lives in the runner today; the same refactor would make it a flag flip rather than copy-paste, so future feature parity (e.g. webhook dispatch from stdio mutations) is cheap.
